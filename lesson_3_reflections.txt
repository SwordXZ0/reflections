When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are collaborating with other developers in a large project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because may be the code that you made will stop working with the new version of the code.
