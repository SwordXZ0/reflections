When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are collaborating with other developers in a large project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because may be the code that you made will stop working with the new version of the code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
You use forks when modifying some's else repository is not permited on GitHub, and in clones that repository to your own account on GitHub.
Clones copy the history and all the files in your repository from gitHub or other computer to your own working directory in your computer.
Brances label a specific commit so that you can reconize it more easily with normal name.
